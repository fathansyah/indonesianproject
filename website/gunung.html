But usually the journey of inexperienced climbers can only end on this lake, because the next climbing route to the Peak of Mahameru is not an easy path. Not only is the difficult terrain in the form of sand and rocks that are prone to landslides, the journey to the highest peak in Java also has other severe challenges, namely the level of the terrain is so steep, very cold temperatures and also the challenge of toxic gases. There is even a regulation that climbers must have come down from the peak before nine in the morning, because it is feared that there will be a change in wind direction that will bring poisonous gas from the active crater towards the hiking trail.</p>
